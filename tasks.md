# MiDRR-Classifier — Task Tracker

Derived from `docs/MiDRR_ML_Development_Plan.md`. Phases are ordered by dependency — everything before Phase 3 can be done without real data.

> **2026-07-01 update:** Post-BFP-consultation, the simulation/analytics design changed
> (see `Diagrams/01`–`06` and the approved plan at
> `C:\Users\ASUS-Pc\.claude\plans\there-has-been-some-goofy-sloth.md`). This adds a new
> **Phase 2.5** (9-feature migration, Turso ingestion, rule-based labeling) that several
> later phases now depend on. Checkboxes below have also been corrected — Phases 6–8 were
> further along than this file previously showed (SHAP, FastAPI, streaming, feedback text
> already shipped), but all of that was built for the **old 6-feature** contract and needs
> to be re-verified/extended once Phase 2.5 lands.

## Phase 0 — Foundations & Decisions

- [x] Reconcile label casing (`High` → `HIGH/MODERATE/LOW`) across `data_schema.py` and tests; add contract test
- [x] Decide labeling strategy; draft expert rubric + κ protocol (`docs/labeling_rubric.md`)
- [x] Freeze telemetry contract v1.1 (`docs/telemetry_contract.md`)
- [x] Lock the six feature **operational definitions** to exact Chapter 3 wording — write them as docstrings in `data_schema.py` (apply two BFP semantics fixes below)
  - `evacuation_time` / `decision_delay` end at `assembly_area_reached`, **not** `emergency_exit`
  - `interaction_frequency` must NOT count extinguisher use when `nearby_player_count == 0` (that's a violation)
- [x] Resolve Chapter 3 **6-features-vs-8-attributes** mismatch — state which raw attributes map to which features, and whether `Decision Sequence`, `Task Completion Time`, `Safety Compliance` are features, raw inputs, or out of scope

---

## Phase 1 — Synthetic Data + Pipeline Hardening

- [x] Write `src/midrr_classifier/synth.py` — synthetic log generator emitting telemetry contract v1.1 format (fire + earthquake, controllable skill level producing separable HIGH/MODERATE/LOW)
- [x] Add a companion notebook `notebooks/synthetic_pipeline.ipynb` showing end-to-end usage
- [x] Replace placeholder `compute_*` formulas in `feature_engineering.py` with Chapter-3-exact definitions; verify against synthetic ground truth
- [x] End-to-end smoke run on synthetic data: raw → features → train → evaluate → confusion matrix PNG
- [x] Implement group-aware stratified train/test split (no `player_id` leaking across splits) in `data_ingestion.py`
- [x] Set up GitHub Actions CI running `pytest` on push (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
- [x] Ensure all synthetic data outputs are clearly labelled as synthetic (mirror the web repo's requirement)

---

## Phase 2 — Telemetry Contract (Cross-Repo)

- [x] Write `docs/telemetry_contract.md` v1.1 with JSON + CSV shapes, per-tick vs per-event spec, full event vocabulary
- [x] Document required new mod instrumentation (per-tick `x/y/z`, `hazard_distance`, `fire_alarm_activate`, `assembly_area_reached`, `nearby_player_count`, `map_metadata.json`)
- [x] **Send `telemetry_contract.md` to Necookie with a hard deadline** — this starts the clock on the longest pole
- [x] Agree on transport layer: **batched CSV export** (PostgreSQL direct read dropped)

---

## Phase 2.5 — BFP-Revised Design Migration (9 Features, Turso, Rule-Based Labeling) *(NEW)*

Source: BFP consultation diagrams (`01`–`06`) + approved plan. Locked decisions: adopt all
9 features; full fire/earthquake parity; train on expert labels + rule-based weak labels
(`label_source`), test set expert-only; ingestion adapter supports both Turso and CSV.
This phase **blocks** Phases 3–9 doing anything meaningful under the old 6-feature schema.

### Step 1 — Contract ✅ (2026-07-01)
- [x] `data_schema.py`: `FEATURE_SCHEMA` 6 → 9 keys (`decision_latency`, `spray_accuracy`, `path_efficiency_ratio`, `hazard_avoidance_ratio`, `evacuation_time`, `interaction_frequency`, `resource_utilization`, `panic_proxy`, `situational_awareness`)
- [x] Rewrite `FEATURE_DEFINITIONS` locked prose for all 9 (fire computation + earthquake analog each)
- [x] Add new event constants: `ext_spray` (+ `hit_fire` flag), `pin_pull`, `hazard_neutralize`, `phase_transition` (Prevention/Intervention/Evacuation), `drop_cover_hold`, `extinguisher_class` field
- [x] Declare `nearby_player_count` in `RAW_LOG_SCHEMA` (currently used in code but undeclared); `session_end` documented as an `EVENT_TYPES` value (it's an event, not a raw-log column)
- [x] Update `INTERACTION_EVENT_TYPES`, `DECISION_LATENCY_ACTION_TYPES` (renamed from `DECISION_DELAY_ACTION_TYPES`), `CH3_ATTRIBUTE_MAPPING` for the 9 features
- [x] Add `label_source` (`expert`/`rule`) to the schema (+ `LABEL_SOURCES` constant)
- [x] `config.py`: `feature_cols` → the 9 (fixed order); `max_depth` `None` → `8`; expose `class_weight` as a config field (still hardcoded in `model_definition.py:78` — wiring is Step 6); add Turso connection fields (`turso_database_url`/`turso_auth_token`, env-sourced)
- [x] `docs/telemetry_contract.md` → **v1.2**: new events, `hit_fire`/`extinguisher_class` fields, `sessions`-table shape (`event_log` JSON + `move_log_csv` + `prep_level`/`confidence`/`simulation_score`/`passed`), Turso transport, 9 features + quake analogs, fix the 10/20 Hz inconsistency (locked to 20 Hz)

  > This step intentionally broke `feature_engineering.py`/`streaming.py` imports (old names removed) — expected, fixed by Step 2.

### Step 2 — Feature engineering ✅ (2026-07-01)
- [x] Add `compute_spray_accuracy`, `compute_resource_utilization`, `compute_situational_awareness` (each dispatches on fire-vs-quake scenario family via `_is_earthquake_scenario`)
- [x] Redefine `compute_panic_proxy` → std-dev of per-tick movement **speed²** (was bearing turn-angles)
- [x] Re-anchor `compute_decision_delay` → `compute_decision_latency`, measured from **SIM_START** (`session_start` event) rather than first hazard exposure
- [x] `build_feature_table()` emits the 9 columns + `preparedness_level` + `label_source`; keep group-by `(player_id, scenario_type)`
- [x] Verified: `pytest tests/` — 23 tests still pass; `test_feature_engineering.py`/`test_streaming.py` fail on old 6-feature names as expected (fixed in Step 7 test bump; `streaming.py` itself still needs its Step 6 update)
- [ ] TODO carried forward: `compute_resource_utilization` doesn't yet check `extinguisher_class` against room type (no `room_type` raw field from the mod yet) — sequencing-only for now

### Step 3 — Labeling ✅ (2026-07-01)
- [x] New `src/midrr_classifier/labeling.py`: `rule_based_label(score)` (≥75 HIGH / 40–74 MODERATE / <40 LOW), `phase_outcome_label()` (Prevention=HIGH / Intervention=MOD / Evacuation=MOD|LOW / fail=LOW)
- [x] Helper to compute rule-vs-expert agreement (κ) for `labeling_rubric.md` validation — `rule_expert_agreement()` (Cohen's κ + raw agreement rate via sklearn)
- [x] Wire into ingestion: `resolve_label()`/`attach_labels()` implement expert > rule-label > rule-score precedence; `data_ingestion.resolve_session_labels()` is the call site the Step 4 Turso/CSV loader will route through
- [x] `docs/labeling_rubric.md` → **v1.1**: documents the game rule-based label + BFP override flow, `label_source`, reaffirms circularity guard, references `labeling.py` functions directly (earthquake DCH BFP/DRRMO sign-off still pending — tracked in Ongoing, unchanged)
- [x] Verified: manual sanity check of all 5 functions + `pytest tests/` — same 23 pass / 2 known-broken (Step 6/7) as before, no new breakage

### Step 4 — Ingestion adapter
- [ ] `data_ingestion.py`: new `load_sessions(source=...)` with two backends — Turso (libSQL client, env-configured `TURSO_DATABASE_URL`/auth token, parses `event_log` JSON + `move_log_csv`, maps `student_name→player_id`/`simulation_type→scenario_type`) and CSV (keep existing `load_raw_logs`/`load_feature_table`)
- [ ] Label resolution: prefer expert override, else rule-based label via `labeling.py`
- [ ] Keep group-aware `split_train_test()`; enforce expert-only test set

### Step 5 — Synthetic data
- [ ] `synth.py`: emit new events (ext_spray hit/miss, pin_pull, hazard_neutralize ×5, phase transitions, quake drop/cover/hold) and 9-feature signal
- [ ] Class distribution → **HIGH 35% / MODERATE 45% / LOW 20%** across **250 sessions** (currently balanced); extend `_PROFILE` with spray-accuracy, pin-pull, situational-awareness, quake DCH-correctness params

### Step 6 — Retrain + downstream (mechanical 6→9 propagation)
- [ ] `model_definition.py`: retrain against 9-feature config (no structural change expected)
- [ ] `inference.py` / `streaming.py`: recompute/serve 9 features; remove stale "Replace with SHAP in Phase 6" docstring in `inference.py`
- [ ] `api/schemas.py` + `api/routes/predict.py`: request adds the 3 new features; SHAP `feature_cols` auto-follows config
- [ ] `api/feedback.py`: encode diagram numeric thresholds (latency >30s, spray <0.40, path <0.50, panic >2.0) alongside existing SHAP templates
- [ ] Expose the streaming route `POST /session/{id}/events` in `api/main.py` (currently only `/predict` + `/health` are mounted)

### Step 7 — Tests + docs
- [ ] Bump all 6-feature assertions to 9 across `tests/` (`test_feature_engineering.py`, `test_streaming.py`, `test_model_definition.py`, `test_data_ingestion.py`)
- [ ] Add unit tests: 3 new compute fns (fire + quake), `labeling.py` thresholds, Turso adapter (mocked client), synth distribution, new `test_api.py` for the 9-field `/predict` schema
- [ ] `test_label_contract.py` unchanged (casing still `HIGH/MODERATE/LOW`)
- [ ] `docs/MiDRR_ML_Development_Plan.md`: 6 → 9 features; add rule-based labeler + Turso ingestion + BFP validation loop; mark Phases 6–8 partially done

**Verification for this phase:** `pytest tests/ -v` all green; end-to-end synthetic smoke run (9 cols, no NaN, both scenarios, class split ≈ 35/45/20); Turso adapter parses a mocked/test `sessions` row into a valid 9-feature raw-log row; `/predict` returns the full contract with 9-feature SHAP importances; streaming route returns a 9-feature snapshot; rule-based labels reproduce the ≥75/40/<40 tiers with expert override precedence and expert-only test split.

---

## Phase 3 — Real Data Collection *(blocked on Phase 2.5)*

- [ ] Pilot run with small N — validate logs match contract v1.2 and 9 features compute correctly
- [ ] Capture expert-rubric labels for each run (raters watching/replaying sessions)
- [ ] Inter-rater reliability pass — resolve disagreements, compute Cohen's/Fleiss' κ
- [ ] Full data-collection runs (Santa Cruz / Calamba sites per Ch3)
- [ ] Version raw data with DVC

---

## Phase 4 — Feature Engineering on Real Data

- [ ] Run real logs through the pipeline; inspect per-feature distributions per class (9 features)
- [ ] Calibrate `SAFE_HAZARD_DISTANCE` (currently hardcoded `5.0`) with domain experts
- [ ] Handle real-world edge cases: missing ticks, players who never evacuate, scenario time-limit caps
- [ ] EDA: per-class feature separability, correlations (informs importance interpretation)

---

## Phase 5 — Model Training, Tuning, Validation

- [ ] Train baseline RF with defaults; record metrics as the floor
- [ ] Stratified k-fold CV (k=5) — report **mean ± std**, not a single split
- [ ] Hyperparameter search over `n_estimators`, `max_depth`, `min_samples_leaf`, `max_features`, `class_weight` (diagram spec starting point: `n_estimators=100`, `max_depth=8`)
- [ ] Address class imbalance (`class_weight="balanced"` and/or resampling)
- [ ] Lock final hyperparameters into `config.py`; retrain on full train split; persist `models/midrr_rf.pkl`

---

## Phase 6 — Evaluation & Explainability

- [x] Compute feature importance using SHAP (`src/midrr_classifier/explainability.py`, `TreeExplainer`) — **built for the 6-feature model; re-verify after Phase 2.5**
- [x] Compute SHAP **per-session** (not only globally) — `predict_preparedness_full()` returns per-student SHAP values — **same 6→9 caveat**
- [ ] Report accuracy, per-class precision/recall/F1 (macro + weighted), confusion matrix
- [ ] Permutation importance as a cross-check against SHAP
- [ ] Persist all metrics to `models/metrics.json` for deterministic figure regeneration
- [ ] Sanity check importances against domain intuition (`decision_latency`, `hazard_avoidance_ratio` should rank high)

---

## Phase 7 — Serving / API

- [x] Build `api/` FastAPI service with `POST /predict` (six-feature body) — **needs the 3 new fields once Phase 2.5 lands**
- [x] Return `{ prepLevel, prepScore, featureImportance[], resultText }` contract (`api/schemas.py`, `api/routes/predict.py`)
- [ ] Expose the streaming/mid-session route (`StreamingPredictor` exists in `streaming.py` but isn't mounted in `api/main.py` — tracked in Phase 2.5 Step 6)
- [ ] Add `POST /leads` and pre/post survey endpoints only if team decides surveys flow through this API
- [ ] Containerize the API
- [ ] Deploy (Render free tier + UptimeRobot keep-alive, or Railway)
- [ ] Set `PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` in `BERONG_SMP_WEB` to the deployed URL

---

## Phase 8 — Adaptive Feedback (ECD / Stealth-Assessment Layer)

- [x] Map predicted level + top SHAP feature contributions → human-readable `resultText` (`api/feedback.py`) — **templates keyed on 6 features; extend for the 3 new ones + diagram thresholds in Phase 2.5 Step 6**
- [ ] Encode the diagram's numeric feedback thresholds (latency >30s, spray accuracy <0.40, path efficiency <0.50, panic proxy >2.0)
- [ ] Define and document the feedback payload schema the mod consumes (cross-repo with Necookie)

---

## Phase 9 — Manuscript & Defense Support

- [ ] Generate publication-quality figures: confusion matrix, feature-importance bar chart, per-class metrics table, CV variance plot
- [ ] Write Chapter 4 results narrative (model performance + which behaviors drive preparedness)
- [ ] Prepare reproducibility appendix: fixed seeds, `config.py` snapshot, `requirements.txt`, data version hash
- [ ] Defense Q&A prep: why RF over alternatives, why 9 features (and how they replaced the original 6), how labels were obtained (expert + rule-based hybrid) and their κ, small-N generalization limits

---

## Ongoing / Cross-Cutting

- [ ] Get BFP/DRRMO to formally validate the earthquake rubric dimensions (`labeling_rubric.md` §4B is drafted but unvalidated)
- [ ] Reconcile `LABEL_CLASSES` order in confusion matrix axis vs dashboard display order
- [ ] Keep `docs/MiDRR_ML_Development_Plan.md`, `telemetry_contract.md`, and `labeling_rubric.md` versions in sync as Phase 2.5 lands
- [ ] Update this file as tasks are completed
